# causality-black-box

This is the official repository for the paper titled "Explaining The Behavior Of Black Box Algorithms Using Causal Learning".

This repository has the following three folders, each containing code on different aspects of paper, listed below:

1. /simulation - code for the HydraNet implmentation, along with the subsequent logistic regression and causal discovery parts of the simulation.
2. /birds - code for the ResNet18 pretrained classification model, output of causal discovery datasets, as well as the implementation of lime and SHAP.
3. /XR - code for XR example, along with the relevant LIME and SHAP implementations.
